> **Note:** This repository is a personal backup of coursework originally developed as part of my studies at Cornerstone College. It was cloned from a institutional and private repository to preserve my contributions and development history.

# Final Project

**Objective:**

The objective would be to create the website using the Figma mockup. Access to the mockup would be shared via email invite. 

The website consists of the following pages: 
* Home  
* My Work
* Services
* Classes
* BeautyTips
* About 
* Contact

This exercise with help to sharpen your HTML, CSS and JS further and also increase your soft skills working as a team.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- **HTML, CSS, and JS:** 60% (code quality of final work, clear indication of work done, responsiveness, resemblence of the mockup)
- **Teamwork:** 40% (attending classes, usage of GitHub, maintaining consistency, presentation)

_Note: There are 8 pages, but the main ones are HOME, CLASSES & CONTACT page. Ensure these pages are done before moving on to the other pages or sections_
